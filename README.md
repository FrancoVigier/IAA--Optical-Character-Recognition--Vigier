# IAA--Optical-Character-Recognition--Vigier
CNN and Decision Tree comparation for Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is known as the system that classifies images according to which character of 
a language they represent. In the present analysis, we take the dataset provided by the professor
(analyzed in more detail in the paper), to train a decision tree and a convolutional neural network to draw comparative 
conclusions between these two methods.
